[![IT Academy](src/assets/git-screenshot.png)](https://codenaud.github.io/sprint-05/)

## Introduction

Welcome to Sprint 05: Angular I, "Onboarding digital," where we delve into the powerful Angular framework to build a dynamic and interactive web application. This project is an exciting foray into Angular's capabilities, focusing on component-based architecture and reactive programming.

## Description

In this project, we explore the following Angular features:

- Components and Data Binding: Learn how to create reusable components and manage data flow between parent and child components.
- Services and Dependency Injection: Utilize Angular services to share data and logic across components.
- Angular Directives: Implement built-in directives for dynamic rendering and user interaction.
- Routing: Set up navigation between different views in the application.

The application is designed to provide a seamless user experience, showcasing how Angular facilitates the development of sophisticated web applications.

## Oboarding

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
